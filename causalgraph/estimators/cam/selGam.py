"""
This Python version aims to replicate the functionality of the R function.
Here are some key points about the translation:

1. We use NumPy for array operations.
2. Instead of `gam` from R, we use `pygam` library which provides similar
    functionality in Python.
3. The p-values are extracted from the fitted GAM model's statistics.
4. The logic for creating and updating `selVec` is adjusted to work with Python's
    0-based indexing.

Note that this translation assumes that the `pygam` library is installed and imported.
You may need to install it using `pip install pygam`.

Also, be aware that there might be some differences in the exact implementation
details between R's `gam` and Python's `pygam`. You may need to fine-tune the GAM
model creation and fitting process to match the exact behavior of the R version.
