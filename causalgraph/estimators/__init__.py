"""
Estimators module for causal discovery.

This module provides various estimators and algorithms for causal discovery,
including:
- CAM (Causal Additive Models)
- FCI (Fast Causal Inference)
- GES (Greedy Equivalence Search)
- LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models)
- NOTEARS (Non-combinatorial Optimization via Trace Exponential and Augmented lagRangian for Structure learning)
- PC (Peter-Clark algorithm)
