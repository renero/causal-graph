version 0.4.3
-------------
- Regressors now accept categorical variables, and adapt their loss function
and architectures
- plot_dag considers luminance to decide font color.
- SHAP values are now scaled and that's the value used along the process.

version 0.4.2
-------------
- Now it is possible to add a prior to ReX. The prior is in the form of a
temporal hierarchy of node names (`List[List[str]]`), so there can be no 
links from a node in a list which is after/deeper to another node in a
previous/higher list.
- Build a DAG (`DAG_rho`) from SHAP discrepancies.
