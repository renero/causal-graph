Contributing
============

We want to make contributing to CausalExplain as easy and transparent as possible.

Development Process
-----------------

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well 
as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

Pull Request Process
------------------

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the docs/ with details of changes, if applicable.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of other developers.

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
--------------------------------------------------------------

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be 
under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that 
covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
